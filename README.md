# Little Periodic
This is a sample project which aims to be proof of concept and study resource for Unity + Vuforia Augmented Reality development.

## Objective
Little Periodic is an augmented reality solution which tracks periodic 
table's element cards and combines them virtually in order to demonstrate 
how elements links to each other and their linkage outputs. 

Little Periodic implements this through displaying virtual elements over 
AR Cards and combining their contents producing new elements.
